**题目：Maximum Subsequence Sum**

Given a sequence of K integers { N1, N2, ..., NK }. A continuous subsequence is defined to be { Ni, Ni+1, ..., Nj } where $1≤i≤j≤K$. The Maximum Subsequence is the continuous subsequence which has the largest sum of its elements. For example, given sequence { -2, 11, -4, 13, -5, -2 }, its maximum subsequence is { 11, -4, 13 } with the largest sum being 20.

Now you are supposed to find the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence.

*Input Specification:*

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies two lines. The first line contains a positive integer K (≤10000). The second line contains K numbers, separated by a space.

*Output Specification:*

For each test case, output in one line the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence. The numbers must be separated by one space, but there must be no extra space at the end of a line. In case that the maximum subsequence is not unique, output the one with the smallest indices i and j (as shown by the sample case). If all the K numbers are negative, then its maximum sum is defined to be 0, and you are supposed to output the first and the last numbers of the whole sequence.

*Sample Input:*

> 10
-10 1 2 3 4 -5 -23 3 7 -21

*Sample Output:*

> 10 1 4

**思路：**使用动态规划的思想，将所有的子串和找出，求最大的即可

- 需要判断输入的数据是否为全负数，如果全是负数，就是从头到尾的输出

- 保留最大子串时需要判断前面的子串和与当前数相加是否更大，如果没有，保留当前数字即可，否者将其继续放入子串序列后

- 还需保存起始与结束位置，位置的存储也分情况判断，如果当前数加到子序列后，那么这条子串的起始下标还是之前 `begin[i]=begin[i-1]`，如果从当前数开始开辟另一条子序列那么，当前的起始就是现在数字的下标 `begin[i]=i`

**代码：**

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int maxn = 10010;
int data[maxn], dp[maxn]; //存储数据和子串和
int beg[maxn] = {0};      //记录当前以i为结尾的子串的起始下标

int main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    bool flag = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cin >> data[i];
        if (data[i] >= 0)
        {
            flag = true; //只要有一个正数就可以进行运算
        }
    }
    if (!flag) //如果全是负数
    {
        cout << "0 " << data[0] << " " << data[n - 1];
        return 0;
    }
    dp[0] = data[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) //状态转移方程
    {
        if (dp[i - 1] + data[i] > data[i])
        {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + data[i];
            beg[i] = beg[i - 1];
        }
        else
        {
            dp[i] = data[i];
            beg[i] = i;
        }
    }
    int end = 0; //结束节点
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        if (dp[i] > dp[end])
        {
            end = i;
        }
    }
    cout << dp[end] << " " << data[beg[end]] << " " << data[end];
    return 0;
}
```

**题目：Find More Coins**

Eva loves to collect coins from all over the universe, including some other planets like Mars. One day she visited a universal shopping mall which could accept all kinds of coins as payments. However, there was a special requirement of the payment: for each bill, she must pay the exact amount. Since she has as many as 104 coins with her, she definitely needs your help. You are supposed to tell her, for any given amount of money, whether or not she can find some coins to pay for it.

*Input Specification:*

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive numbers: `N` (≤ $10^4$, the total number of coins) and `M` (≤ $10^2$, the amount of money Eva has to pay). The second line contains `N` face values of the coins, which are all positive numbers. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

*Output Specification:*

For each test case, print in one line the face values V1≤V2≤⋯≤Vk such that V1+V2+⋯+Vk=`M`. All the numbers must be separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line. If such a solution is not unique, output the smallest sequence. If there is no solution, output "No Solution" instead.

Note: sequence {A[1], A[2], ...} is said to be "smaller" than sequence {B[1], B[2], ...} if there exists k≥1 such that A[i]=B[i] for all i<k, and A[k] < B[k].

*Sample Input 1:*

> 8 9
5 9 8 7 2 3 4 1

*Sample Output 1:*

> 1 3 5

*Sample Input 2:*

> 4 8
7 2 4 3

*Sample Output 2:*

> No Solution

**思路：**最后输出字典序最小的结果，先将其从大到小进行排序，将正确的值反向进行查找，跳转放入数组输出

不是很理解，背过背包模板

**代码：**

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int N, M, coins[10010];
int dp[10010], choice[10010][110];
bool cmp(int a, int b)
{
    return a > b;
}

int main()
{
    cin >> N >> M;
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
    {
        cin >> coins[i];
    }
    sort(coins + 1, coins + N + 1, cmp); //将硬币从大到小排序
    //背包模板
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
    {
        for (int j = M; j >= coins[i]; j--)
        {
            if (dp[j] <= dp[j - coins[i]] + coins[i])
            {
                choice[i][j] = true;
                dp[j] = dp[j - coins[i]] + coins[i];
            }
        }
    }

    if (dp[M] != M)
    {
        cout << "No Solution";
    }
    else
    {
        vector<int> arr;
        int v = M, index = N;
        while (v > 0) //反向查找，保证字典序最小
        {
            if (choice[index][v])
            {
                arr.push_back(coins[index]);
                v -= coins[index];
            }
            index--;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++)
        {
            if (i != 0)
            {
                cout << " ";
            }
            cout << arr[i];
        }
    }
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
```
