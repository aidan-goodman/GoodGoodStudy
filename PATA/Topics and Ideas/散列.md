### 思想解释

将元素通过某种方式转换为整数使其尽量唯一的表示这个元素的特质

如：求在长度为N的数组中，求M个数有没有出现过，就可以设置一个judge[]以Ni作为下标，将值置为true，查询时只需判断Mi作为下标时值是否为true即可

将直接输入的数作为数组下标直接表示这个数的特质的方式经常使用

**题目：Broken Keyboard**

On a broken keyboard, some of the keys are worn out. So when you type some sentences, the characters corresponding to those keys will not appear on screen.

Now given a string that you are supposed to type, and the string that you actually type out, please list those keys which are for sure worn out.

*Input Specification:*

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the 1st line contains the original string, and the 2nd line contains the typed-out string. Each string contains no more than 80 characters which are either English letters $[A-Z]$ (case insensitive), digital numbers $[0-9]$, or `_` (representing the space). It is guaranteed that both strings are non-empty.

*Output Specification:*

For each test case, print in one line the keys that are worn out, in the order of being detected. The English letters must be capitalized. Each worn out key must be printed once only. It is guaranteed that there is at least one worn out key.

*Sample Input:*

> 7_This_is_a_test
_hs_s_a_es

*Sample Output:*

> 7TI

**思路：**

1. 字符串写法：遍历预想字符串的每个字符去实际字符串中查找，如果本身和它大写形式查找的返回值都是`string::npos`，保留其大写形式

2. 散列写法：设立一个标记数组（字符会自动转为ASCII码作为数字下标），遍历预想字符串，如果不相同且没被标记过，放入数组

**代码：**

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cctype>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    /*字符串写法
    string s1, s2, ans;
    cin >> s1 >> s2;
    for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) //遍历字符串1中的每个字符去字符串2中查找
        if (s2.find(s1[i]) == string::npos && ans.find(toupper(s1[i])) == string::npos)
        { //查找字符和字符的大写，查找失败返回string::npos
            ans += toupper(s1[i]);
        }
    cout << ans;
    */
    int flag[128] = {0};
    vector<char> vc;
    string s1, s2;
    cin >> s1 >> s2;
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    while (i < s1.length()) //遍历全部的预想结果
    {
        if (s1[i] != s2[j])
        {
            if (!flag[s1[i]]) //还没有标记过
            {
                flag[tolower(s1[i])] = 1;
                flag[toupper(s1[i])] = 1;     //将大小写全部标记成1
                vc.push_back(toupper(s1[i])); //放入大写形式
            }
            i++;
        }
        else
        {
            i++;
            j++;
        }
    }
    for (char i : vc)
    {
        cout << i;
    }
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
```

**题目：To Buy or Not to Buy**

Eva would like to make a string of beads with her favorite colors so she went to a small shop to buy some beads. There were many colorful strings of beads. However the owner of the shop would only sell the strings in whole pieces. Hence Eva must check whether a string in the shop contains all the beads she needs. She now comes to you for help: if the answer is `Yes`, please tell her the number of extra beads she has to buy; or if the answer is `No`, please tell her the number of beads missing from the string.

For the sake of simplicity, let's use the characters in the ranges $[0-9]$, $[a-z]$, and $[A-Z]$ to represent the colors. For example, the 3rd string in Figure 1 is the one that Eva would like to make. Then the 1st string is okay since it contains all the necessary beads with 8 extra ones; yet the 2nd one is not since there is no black bead and one less red bead.

![          Figure1](https://secure-static.wolai.com/static/m8zRo6xL2MFd4vhYpA66U9/image.png)

*Input Specification:*

Each input file contains one test case. Each case gives in two lines the strings of no more than 1000 beads which belong to the shop owner and Eva, respectively.

*Output Specification:*

For each test case, print your answer in one line. If the answer is `Yes`, then also output the number of extra beads Eva has to buy; or if the answer is `No`, then also output the number of beads missing from the string. There must be exactly 1 space between the answer and the number.

*Sample Input 1:*

> ppRYYGrrYBR2258
YrR8RrY

*Sample Output 1:*

> Yes 8

*Sample Input 2:*

> ppRYYGrrYB225
YrR8RrY

*Sample Output 2:*

> No 2

**思路：**使用数组或集合对每个颜色的个数进行记录，减去需要购买的值（且个数不为0），不存在将lack++；根据lack进行输出

**代码：**

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    unordered_map<char, int> mci;
    string str1, str2;
    cin >> str1 >> str2;
    /*数组下标标记法
    int book[256];
    for (int i = 0; i < str1.length(); i++)
        book[str1[i]]++;
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < str2.length(); i++)
    {
        if (book[str2[i]] > 0)
            book[str2[i]]--;
        else
            result++;
    }
    */
    //集合标记
    for (int i = 0; i < str1.length(); i++)
    {
        if (mci.count(str1[i]))
        {
            mci[str1[i]]++;
        }
        else
        {
            mci[str1[i]] = 1;
        }
    }
    int lack = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < str2.length(); i++)
    {
        if (mci.count(str2[i]) && mci[str2[i]] != 0)
        {
            mci[str2[i]]--;
        }
        else
        {
            lack++;
        }
    }
    if (!lack)
    {
        cout << "Yes " << str1.length() - str2.length();
    }
    else
    {
        cout << "No " << lack;
    }

    system("pause");
    return 0;

**题目：Be Unique**

Being unique is so important to people on Mars that even their lottery is designed in a unique way. The rule of winning is simple: one bets on a number chosen from $[1,10^4]$. The first one who bets on a unique number wins. For example, if there are 7 people betting on { 5 31 5 88 67 88 17 }, then the second one who bets on 31 wins.

*Input Specification:*

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains a line which begins with a positive integer $N (≤10^5)$ and then followed by N bets. The numbers are separated by a space.

*Output Specification:*

For each test case, print the winning number in a line. If there is no winner, print `None` instead.

*Sample Input 1:*

> 7 5 31 5 88 67 88 17

*Sample Output 1:*

> 31

*Sample Input 2:*

> 5 888 666 666 888 888

*Sample Output 2:*

> None

**思路：**使用两个数组分别记录个数和输入顺序

**代码：**

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int flag[100001] = {0}, num[100000]; //flag进行个数统计，num记录输入顺序
int main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cin >> num[i];
        flag[num[i]]++; //将输入的数作为下标自增
    }
    bool f = true; //判断是否有符合条件的值输出
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        if (flag[num[i]] == 1)
        {
            cout << num[i];
            f = false; //有输出
            break;
        }
    }
    if (f)
    {
        cout << "None";
    }
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
```

**题目：String Subtraction**

Given two strings S1 and S2, $S=S1−S2$ is defined to be the remaining string after taking all the characters in S2 from S1. Your task is simply to calculate $S1−S2$ for any given strings. However, it might not be that simple to do it **fast**.

*Input Specification:*

Each input file contains one test case. Each case consists of two lines which gives S1 and S2, respectively. The string lengths of both strings are no more than $10^4$. It is guaranteed that all the characters are visible ASCII codes and white space, and a new line character signals the end of a string.

*Output Specification:*

For each test case, print $S1−S2$ in one line.

*Sample Input:*

> They are students.
aeiou

*Sample Output:*

> Thy r stdnts.

**思路：**使用数组以字符的ASCII码为下标标记S1中每个出现的字符值为1，S2出现的字符置为0，遍历S1只输出标记数组值为1的字符

**代码：**

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int flag[256] = {0};
int main()
{
    string str1, str2;
    getline(cin, str1);
    getline(cin, str2);
    for (int i = 0; i < str1.length(); i++)
    {
        flag[str1[i]] = 1;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < str2.length(); i++)
    {
        flag[str2[i]] = 0;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < str1.length(); i++)
    {
        if (flag[str1[i]])
        {
            cout << str1[i];
        }
    }
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
```

**题目：Find Coins**

Eva loves to collect coins from all over the universe, including some other planets like Mars. One day she visited a universal shopping mall which could accept all kinds of coins as payments. However, there was a special requirement of the payment: for each bill, she could only use exactly two coins to pay the exact amount. Since she has as many as $10^5$ coins with her, she definitely needs your help. You are supposed to tell her, for any given amount of money, whether or not she can find two coins to pay for it.

*Input Specification:*

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive numbers: $N (≤10^5$, the total number of coins) and $M(≤10^3$, the amount of money Eva has to pay). The second line contains N face values of the coins, which are all positive numbers no more than 500. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

*Output Specification:*

For each test case, print in one line the two face values V1 and V2 (separated by a space) such that $V1+V2=M$ and $V1≤V2$. If such a solution is not unique, output the one with the smallest V1. If there is no solution, output `No Solution` instead.

*Sample Input 1:*

> 8 15
1 2 8 7 2 4 11 15

*Sample Output 1:*

> 4 11

*Sample Input 2:*

> 7 14
1 8 7 2 4 11 15

*Sample Output 2:*

> No Solution

**思路：**使用数组标记每个面值出现的次数，然后从1到bill对每一个面值进行遍历（规则就是从小到大），判断输出

**代码：**

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int flag[1001] = {0}; //用来统计每个面值出现了几次
int main()
{
    int n, m, temp;
    cin >> n >> m;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cin >> temp;
        flag[temp]++;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) //对每个面值的硬币从小到大判断（保证输出规则）
    {
        if (flag[i]) //当前面值存在
        {
            flag[i]--;       //存在就-1，防止出现一个数出现了一次但它的二倍等于bill
            if (flag[m - i]) //符合相加条件的硬币也存在
            {
                cout << i << " " << m - i; //输出
                system("pause");
                return 0;
            }
            flag[i]++;
        }
    }
    cout << "No Solution";
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
```
